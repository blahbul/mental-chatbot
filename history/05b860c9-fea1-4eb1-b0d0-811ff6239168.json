            "text": "I hear you.  It sounds like you're going through a tough time right now, and not being able to sleep because of anxiety is incredibly difficult.  I'm so sorry you're experiencing this.  \n\nCould you tell me a little more about what's causing your anxiety?  Sometimes just talking about it can help.  There's no pressure to share anything you're not comfortable with, but the more information you can give me, the better I can understand what you're going through and offer some helpful suggestions.\n\nIn the meantime, here are a few things that might help ease your anxiety and promote sleep:\n\n* **Deep breathing exercises:** Try inhaling deeply through your nose, holding for a few seconds, and then exhaling slowly through your mouth.  Repeating this several times can help calm your nervous system.\n* **Progressive muscle relaxation:**  This involves systematically tensing and releasing different muscle groups in your body.  There are guided meditations available online that can help you with this.\n* **Mindfulness meditation:** Focusing on the present moment, rather than worrying about the future or dwelling on the past, can be very effective in reducing anxiety.  There are many free guided mindfulness meditations available on apps like Calm or Headspace.\n* **Gentle movement:**  A short walk, some stretching, or even just gentle yoga can help release tension and improve sleep.\n\nRemember, you're not alone in feeling this way. Many people experience anxiety and sleep problems.  It's important to be kind to yourself and to seek support when you need it.\n\nIf your anxiety is persistent or severe, or if you're finding it difficult to cope, please consider reaching out to a mental health professional.  They can provide a proper diagnosis and recommend the best course of treatment for you.  \n\nI'm here to listen and support you in any way I can.  What would you like to talk about next?\n"
